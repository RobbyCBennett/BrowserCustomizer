## Introduction

Add custom CSS to one or many sites. Sometimes websites don't look the way you want them to. Simplify or change them with Cascading Style Sheets. CSS can be applied to many pages with the * wildcard. It is applied before the HTML loads. The CSS is edited in a popup window or the big options page, not in a sidebar of the page; you are not hindered by the page.
